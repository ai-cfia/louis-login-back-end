# Louis Login Backend

Welcome to the Louis Login Backend - a secure and seamless single sign-on solution that provides users with a convenient way to authenticate across multiple client applications.

## Overview

Louis Login Backend serves as the bridge between client applications and the Louis Login Frontend, where users provide their email for authentication. Our backend system is designed to ensure a streamlined authentication process, minimize disruptions, and handle unexpected user behaviors or system states.

## Features

- **Email-Based Authentication**: Users only need to provide their email to initiate the login process.
- **Token-Based Verification**: Leveraging JWT for secure token generation and validation.
- **Flexible Redirection**: Smartly handle redirections based on system states and user actions.
- **Error Handling**: Designed to gracefully manage disruptions in the authentication flow.

## Getting Started

1. **Visit the Client Application**: Start your authentication journey from the client application website.
2. **Provide Your Email**: If not already authenticated, you'll be redirected to the Louis Login Frontend to input your email.
3. **Verify Via Email**: Once submitted, you'll receive a verification link in your inbox. Clicking on this link will complete the authentication process.
4. **Seamless Redirection**: After verification, you'll be automatically redirected to the original client application, now authenticated.
